## DeptfordX festival 2018

### Installation: Algorithm, Plants, Printed words & word cluster visualisations (centroidal voronai tesselations)

### *Attendees were asked to cut up printed pages and paste them onto the board with PVC glue*

#### Chronology

1. An unconventional (for tech) algorithm design + visualization was sketched on whiteboard (@London Hackspace Hackney RIP!) ![Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYqoUzVjT50/)
2. The algorithm was developed ![Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZRGAQUjYFf/)
3. It all took longer than expected ![Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZWoCzqjuPx/)
4. The board for participants to mount their designs was prepared ![Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZrHKUZjGzp/)
5. Plants and algorithm were installed around an old piano in the polytunnel ![Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZrKMbDjSLZ/)
6. The algorithm code (behind) is run on Wikipedia and the results (overlay) are output ![Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZtTfdQjGDb/)
7. The exhibition is opened the following day ![Link](https://twitter.com/Deptfordx/status/914500305773096960)
8. The printer was working and all! ![Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZtYcn2Hqn6/)
9. People came, experienced the space with plants w/ words, took word/visualization printouts, cut them up and pasted them on the board (photos were taken by a participant photographer but never sent to me :/)
10. The results were output on paper (crumpled artifact) ![Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgq68yKjNPz/)
11. Relooking at the project after a day of code development ![Link](https://twitter.com/nvsblArchitects/status/1353476398451732481)
12. The garden was destroyed soon after but not without [a lot of resistance from some wonderful, brave people](https://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2019/10/30/photos-of-the-two-month-occupation-of-the-old-tidemill-wildlife-garden-prior-to-its-violent-eviction)
