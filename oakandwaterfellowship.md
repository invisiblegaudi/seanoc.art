Oak and Water Fellowship
========================

Overview
--------

For this years DeptfordX I wondered if these magical new tools, LLMs, could provide a new angle on my previous project, Oak-means, which linked two concepts together via Wikipeda, outputting all the steps as words, clustering them and generating an image from them.

The idea of that previous project was that algorithms are our new nature and they are running invisibly in the background, digesting our data, analysing our actions and governing our lives. In the installation I wanted people to experience an algorithm tangibly and to turn it into art. I used the conceptual artwork "An Oak Tree" by Michael Craig-Martin and had an algorithm attempt to understand it using wikipedia as a neural network. It produced print outs of the data resulting from this "understanding". Participants were then asked to make the artwork using cut ups of the output.

This time I asked chatgpt to link the two concepts, which it did but without the exhilirating traversal of all the concepts on wikipedia. As Michael Craig-Martin's work attempted to represent/challenge the christian concept of transubstantiaion, I asked chatgpt what if these concepcts were to used to form their own religion and to generate an advertisement for it. It did and called it **The Oak and Water fellowship**

Earlier in the summer I read James Lovelock's book The Novacene where he predicts the future with machines replacing use as the dominant life on Earth in keeping with his Gaia hyposthesis. In his prediction, machines take over the function of maintaining the world, they keep us alive as part of the eco-system and as they can reason 10,000 times faster than us, we will appear still like plants. I thought as I was using the burgeoning intelligence of such a life to advertise a religion, it should also design the ritual so that i was intended to appease them, much like pagan religions wanted to appease the gods who might dispose of us if displeased.

The result is this event which asks participants to submit offerings to demonstrate unique human qualities. The AI designed the entire ritual, itself suggesting altered reality as the perfect way to bridge the physical world with the digital. It suggested that the offerings be transubstanted into glyphs or constellations within the universe of the "Digital Divine".
